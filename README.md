# Buddy

Buddy is a lightweight Facebook library for Rails 3.

## Overview

* Support for iFrame Apps
* Uses signed\_request parameters for authentication
* Supports the Graph API and old REST API
* Fully compatible with **Rails 3** and **Ruby 1.9.2**

## Install

Add the following to your Gemfile

    gem 'buddy'

or for the latest Git version

    gem 'buddy', :git => 'git://github.com/buddybrand/buddy.git'

Generate and edit config/buddy.yml

    rails generate buddy_config

## Usage

Buddy adds all parameters contained in _signed\_request_ to the params[:fb] hash. See [Canvas Authentication](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/canvas)

To require the user to install the application add this to your ApplicationController:

    before_filter :ensure_application_is_installed

If the user authorized the application you can do API calls like this:

    # Publish to Graph API:
    facebook_session.post('/me/feed', :message => 'Hi there!')

    # Reading from Graph API:
    facebook_session.get('/me')

    # REST API
    facebook_session.call('users.getInfo')


## Todo

* Add tests
* Add some examples
